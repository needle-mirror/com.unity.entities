# Entities package

The Entities package is part of Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS). It provides a data-oriented implementation of the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. 

For a full list of ECS-related packages, refer to [ECS packages](ecs-packages.md). It is not common to use the Entities package by itself; usually, a combination of Entities Graphics, Unity Physics, and/or Netcode for Entities is used. 

See the [ECS Samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples) for introductory material, including tutorials, samples, and videos.

    /// These flags help to reduce the number of unnecessary transform components in baked entities based on their 
    /// intended use at runtime.
    ///
    /// The Dynamic flag replicates as close as possible the GameObject data and structure.
    /// These flags are used whenever an entity is requested during conversion, for example, via
    /// <see cref="IBaker.GetEntity"/>. Bakers for default GameObject components add the appropriate
    /// TransformUsageFlags too. For example, in the case of the baker for MeshRenderer, Renderable is added as a
    /// TransformUsageFlag.
    ///
    /// More than one baker can indicate different TransformUsageFlags for the same entity. All those flags are combined
    /// together before the transform components are added to the entity. For example if a baker requests for an entity
    /// to be Dynamic and another baker requests for the same entity to be in WorldSpace, the entity is considered
    /// to be Dynamic and in WorldSpace when the transform components are added to the entity.
    ///
    /// These are a few examples on how to use TransformUsageFlags can help to reduce the number of unnecessary
    /// transforms components on entities:
    ///
    /// If you have a GameObject representing a building and that building contains a child GameObject that
    /// is a window (these entities aren't going to move at runtime). If both entities are only marked as Renderable,
    /// then they don't need to be in a hierarchy and all their transform information can be combined in a
    /// <see cref="Unity.Transforms.LocalToWorld"/> component (in WorldSpace). In this case both entities only have a <see cref="Unity.Transforms.LocalToWorld"/>
    /// component and they don't have <see cref="Unity.Transforms.LocalTransform"/> and <see cref="Unity.Transforms.Parent"/> unnecessarily.
    ///
    /// In another example, the same window GameObject could be part of a ship instead of a building. In that case,
    /// the ship is marked as Dynamic and the window is still Renderable. The window entity ends up
    /// with all the required transform components to follow the ship around when it sails (<see cref="Unity.Transforms.LocalToWorld"/>,
    /// <see cref="Unity.Transforms.LocalTransform"/> and <see cref="Unity.Transforms.Parent"/>).
    ///
    /// A building GameObject could have a helicopter GameObject on the roof (as a child). In this case the building is
    /// still Renderable, but the helicopter is marked as Dynamic because it can take off. The helicopter has the
    /// transform components to be moved (<see cref="Unity.Transforms.LocalToWorld"/>, <see cref="Unity.Transforms.LocalTransform"/>), but it isn't
    /// parented to the building and its transform data is in world space.
    ///
    /// In the case of a ship with a helicopter, both are marked as dynamic and the helicopter entity is a
    /// child of the ship, so it follows the ship around when it sails. In this particular case when the helicopter
    /// takes off, the hierarchy needs to be broken manually at runtime and the transform data converted to world
    /// space.
    ///
    /// If the helicopter can shoot some bullets, the bullet entity prefab should be marked as Dynamic so it can be
    /// instantiated at the right position and moved.
    ///
    /// There is also a case where an Entity might be stripped out from the final world during baking. This happens
    /// when there is no baker adding a TransformUsageFlag to it (TranformUsageFlags.None counts as adding a
    /// TransformUsageFlag). An example of this is a GameObject that's created in the Editor Hierarchy to group their
    /// children at authoring time for organizational purposes, but has no use at runtime. In this case, the children
    /// are moved to world space. There is an exception to this stripping rule, if an entity that has no
    /// TransformUsageFlags has a Dynamic parent and Dynamic children, then that entity is considered Dynamic as
    /// well and it isn't stripped out.

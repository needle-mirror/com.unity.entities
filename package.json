    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Enabled content downloads from the Editor while in Playmode.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Entities Hierarchy shows content for _Dont Destroy On Load_ scene in playmode.\n* Prefab reference disappears after instantiating the prefab in runtime and rebaking.\n* Entity inspector now differentiate editors for component types when type names are the same but namespaces are different.\n* compile error when using 'unsafe' in one partial system (that's generated) but not another\n* compile error when having mismatched using statements in one partial system that's different than another\n* Fixed an error where an `EntityQuery` whose `WithAny` list contained a mix of enableable and disableable components would fail to match entities with at least one of the non-enableable components, if all of its enableable Any components were disabled. As a side effect, queries with `WithAny` constraints should now have slightly faster matching.\n* For empty scene sections, `SceneSectionData.BoundingVolume` will no longer contain NaN values, and the `BoundingVolume.IsValid` property will return `true` as expected. Note that converting this field to an `AABB` will still result in NaN values; for now, this case will need special-case handling in user code.\n* Massively reduced reflection on startup in player builds by moving work to an ILPostProcessor.\n* Unit test Instability (memory corruption) caused by dynamically registering new types with the TypeManager.\n\n### Security"
